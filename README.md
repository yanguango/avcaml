#AVCaml

AVCaml is a website to visualize algorithm, which is built on OCaml and Js_of_caml. It's just my exercise when I learned OCaml and functional programming.

#Requirements
+ OCaml
+ JS_of_ocaml
+ camlfind

#Build
## Build Single File
```shell
bash build.sh bubble_sort
```

##Build All Files

Now you need to add new file to build shell - `build_all.sh`

```shell
bash build_all.sh
```
